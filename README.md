## Conclusion
This render is the first practical project I started after studying the computer graphics course "games101" by Yan Lingqi.

I start from tutorial: https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki ,after that, i got a render picture:

Next, https://github.com/SunXLei/SRender, In this open source project, we have gradually added mobile camera, Win32 interactive interface and other functions to the render. In addition, I also used the model resources in the project.

This is the final render effect:
